## Task

Your task is to analyze the frequency of characters in a list of strings provided as arguments.

## Description

The `my_ngram.c` program takes a list of strings as command-line arguments and calculates the frequency of each character present in those strings. It ignores the program name itself and considers the subsequent strings provided as input for analysis.

## Installation

To install my_ngram, you can clone the GitHub repository, navigate to the directory, and compile the program using a command make. Here's how you can do it:
gitt
git clone https://github.com/muminoff707/arc-01-my_ngram.git
cd my_ngram
make

This will clone the repository, navigate to the my_ngram directory, and compile the program using the provided Makefile.

## Usage

Once compiled, you can run the program by providing strings as command-line arguments. Here's how you can use it:
```bash
./my_ngram string1 string2 string3 ...
```

Replace `string1`, `string2`, `string3`, etc. with the strings you want to analyze. The program will then output the frequency of each character present in those strings.
